## Design Choices
* The choice of **Ruby on Rails** framework was made over other options like **Node.js/Express.js** or **Java/Spring** because the app should be deployed as quickly as possible.
* **React.js** was chosen for the frontend due to making code reusable and simplifying many things compared to **vanilla JavaScript** or **jQuery**. It also allows ease of use compared to other view layer libraries such as **Angular.js** or **Vue.js**.
* Using **PostgreSQL** as a database over noSQL databases because it allows more flexibility, stability, speed for querying, and relational data.
