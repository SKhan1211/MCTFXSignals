# User Routing

## Routes
- For users routes, I am using the following CRUD verbs/actions: create, show, update, destroy. Initially, only the create is important so new users can sign up. Eventually, I want to allow users to go to a profile page and update their info or completely delete their account. The account deleting feature will ask if they are sure, ask to match password, and then allow them to re-initialize their account within 5 days. Once those days pass, their user entry will be completely wiped from the database.
